Hi, Iâ€™m Kamran JalilðŸ‘‹

I am a Flutter App-Developer (Front-end), a Tech Enthusiast, an Astrophile and a Public Speaker.

   - Iâ€™m currently persuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Systems Engineering From Uet Peshawar.
   - Apart from Studies, I am constantly working on my App-development skills to polish and improve them.
   - At the moment I am learning Flutter for back-end (Firebase) and planning to study more about AWS and MS-Azure.  
   - Iâ€™m looking to for an opportunity to work with and learn from highly skilled and experienced Flutter App-Developers.
   - You can reach me through my e-mail: kamranjalil1006@gmail.com 

By the way, currently working on some coolðŸ˜Ž projects and will update my profile soon.
